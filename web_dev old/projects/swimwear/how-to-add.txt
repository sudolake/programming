 HOW TO ADD ITEMS:

to add a single item page (a page for an item)

1. go to an already created page (ex. item6.html)
2. copy everything
3. change what you have to, u dont have to change any css, just the image and the text
4. go to swimwear.html (where all the items are displayed)
5. change the "href=#" of the item to the item page you want it to link to ex. "href="../single-page-items/item5.html".
  THE END




to add a completely new item to the "all items" page:

1. copy this code under the last item thats in the code

<div class="item swimwear-yes bikini-no accessories-no">
    <a class="no-deco" href="#" target="_blank">
    <img src="../images/s3.png" alt="swimwear">
    <h5>...</h5>
    <price>$62.00</price>
    </a>
</div>

2. replace the image path with the image path you want to choose
3. change the title and the price
4. select what filter it is (ex. if its a swimwear, the classes should be: item(necessary) swimwear-yes bikini-no accessories-no)


note: you have some items that have prices but dont have an image to them (Almofada v.1 & Almofada v.2), for these, change the image and the classes (so they get filtered) and remove the class "blank-space" from the "img" element



TO ADD THE "WOMEN" page at the top, thats a little more complex because you have to mess with javascript so the filtering works, just message me and I'll do it for free, its really simple but hard if you didnt write the code for it, its really no big deal, my email is matej.krajcovic3@gmail.com, msg me and i'll do it
